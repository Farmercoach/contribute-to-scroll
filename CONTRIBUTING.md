SCROLL ZKVM 

End Game 2.0

The current paradigm in decentralized Zkvm technology hinges on the principle of global consensus. Essentially, the primary aim of contemporary blockchain systems is to achieve global synchronization among all network participants, ensuring a uniform system perspective. While this might not be the sole approach to constructing decentralized ledgers, it is rooted in the foundational theory of distributed systems, which predominantly revolves around consensus. As of now, we lack alternative methods to bypass this consensus requirement.

Consequently, the prevailing strategy for enhancing scalability and achieving high-performance decentralized ledgers involves the development of lightweight blockchains that operate atop the robust layer 1 blockchains equipped with comprehensive global consensus mechanisms, which are indispensable.

At present, these secondary layer 2 chains are generally developed using Zero-knowledge technology, enabling the verification of the Layer 2 network's state by submitting a concise proof to the Layer 1 chain. Alternatively, they employ optimistic roll-ups, where any incorrect state of the Layer 2 system can be corrected by issuing a challenge verifiable on the Layer 1 chain.

In both scenarios, Layer 2 blockchains rely on Layer 1 for verification purposes without being an integral part of it. They function more as ancillary applications. For instance, they cannot leverage the established consensus on Layer 1 beyond verification â€“ the architecture of these Layer 2 systems tends to be somewhat centralized, and they could benefit from increased decentralization, such as in the selection of an entity responsible for submitting state proofs to the Layer 1 chain.

Moreover, the apparent separation of these chains from their parent chain suggests a potential alternative configuration where the chains are effectively integrated within the foundational Layer 1 chain. This integration could facilitate trustless interactions among subchains, enabling, for example, a decentralized application on one chain to initiate flash loans from another. Essentially, different Layer 2 chains could act as shards of a unified state, reminiscent of earlier sharding concepts for decentralization, sharing consensus assurances with the foundational Layer 1 chain and collectively forming a cohesive network.

In my view, this integration represents the ultimate evolution of the Layer 1/Layer 2 narrative. I hope and believe this is the vision behind Scroll ZKVM, which aims to establish an ecosystem of interconnected Layer 2 chains reliant on the foundational Layer 1 layer for consensus. The incorporation of Zero-Knowledge proofs into these chains will follow, with the ultimate goal of linking all chains using Zero-Knowledge technology. This will transform all Layer 2 chains into shards of a unified state, with many Layer 1 chain serving as a beacon chain, facilitating trustless interactions and providing consensus and economic incentives.
